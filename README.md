# Deep-Belief-Network-and-Logistic-Regression-For-Software-Fault-Prediction
## Recreation of "Deep Learning for Just-In-Time Defect Prediction"

*Logistic Regression Classifier over expressive features built using Deep Belief Network over initialing selected features.  
*Used Bugzilla's as it was the most balanced dataset containing 36% defects.

## Results

*Reconstruction error while training the first 3 layers of RBM
